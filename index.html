            <h3>Abstract</h3>
            <p>
                The universe is a vast and ever-expanding entity, presenting one of the most intriguing phenomena in modern astrophysics. This paper explores the evidence supporting the universe's expansion, tracing its discovery from Hubble's Law to contemporary findings such as cosmic microwave background radiation and the acceleration of expansion due to dark energy. By examining key observational data, such as Type Ia supernovae and measurements from the Planck mission, this paper highlights the critical milestones in our understanding of cosmology. Despite remarkable progress, the nature of dark energy and the ultimate fate of the universe remain unsolved mysteries.

            <h3>Analysis and Discussion</h3>
            <p>
                Evidence supporting the expansion of the universe:
            </p>
            <p>
                In the 1920s, Edwin Hubble revealed evidence showing that
                the universe is expanding. Hubble studied the redshift of light from distant galaxies. He
                used the Mount Wilson Observatory to make these observations. He found that galaxies farther away showed
                more redshifts, showing they moved away at faster speeds. this made Hubble's Law which
                shows a relationship between v equals H₀ multiplied by d. In this equation, v
                represents how fast a galaxy moves away. The variable d is the distance to the galaxy. H₀
                is the Hubble constant. This concept was introduced by Hubble in 1929.
            </p>
            <p>
                Hubble's observations built from the ideas of Vesto Slipher, who detected redshifts
                in light from nebulae (later identified as galaxies) in the 1910s. These findings provided
                support for Georges Lemaître's theoretical prediction of the expanding universe, this was
                derived from Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity (Einstein, 1917). The idea of an
                expanding cosmos ended the theories in a static universe.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even more evidence for the universe's expansion came when cosmic
                background radiation (CMB) was found in 1965 by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson. CMB is
                a faint microwave radiation which flows through the universe. It was initially interpreted as
                the residual heat from the Big Bang. This discovery proved the predictions made by the Big
                Bang theory and provided a view of the universe when it was 380,000 years old (Penzias
                and Wilson, 1965).
            </p>
            <p>
                The uniformity and slight anisotropies in the CMB, observed from space missions such as COBE,
                WMAP, and Planck, show scientists what the universe looked like when it was young and
                how it evolved as time passed. The measured characteristics of CMB prove the theory of
                an expanding universe, which began approximately 13.8 billion years ago (Planck
                Collaboration, 2018).
            </p>
            <p>
                Another discovery in the expansion of the universe is the constant increasing rate of
                expansion. In the late 1990s, two independent research teams studying Type Ia supernovae
                (a class of standardizable cosmic candles) found that distant supernovae were dimmer
                than expected. This showed them that the universe's expansion was speeding up rather
                than slowing down (Riess et al., 1998; Perlmutter et al., 1999).
            </p>
            <p>
                The scientists found that the constantly increasing rate of expansion was because of a force
                called dark energy, which makes up approximately 68% of the universe's total energy density
                (Planck Collaboration, 2018). Even though scientists barely understand the force, dark
                energy is thought to act as a repulsive force counteracting the attractive force of gravity. The
                curretn model of cosmology, the ΛCDM model, includes dark energy as a
                cosmological constant (Λ). This was introduced by Einstein and later repurposed to
                explain the phenomenon.

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
                The ever expanding universe is still currently a mysteru to scientists across the globe. As humans
                evolve gaining better technology and minds getting smarter, we are getting closer to solving the
                universe which would provide us with answers to the future.
