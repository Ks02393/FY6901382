                Evidence supporting the expansion of the universe:
            </p>
            <p>
                In the 1920s, it was Edwin Hubble who revealed the first concrete evidence showing that
                the universe is expanding. Hubble studied the redshift of light from distant galaxies. He
                used the Mount Wilson Observatory for his observations. Galaxies farther away showed
                more redshifts, indicating they moved away at faster speeds, he discovered. Hubble's Law
                shows a relationship. It expresses that v equals H₀ multiplied by d. In this equation, v
                represents how fast a galaxy moves away. The variable d is the distance to the galaxy. H₀
                is the Hubble constant. This concept was introduced by Hubble in 1929.
            </p>
            <p>
                Hubble's observations built on the earlier work of Vesto Slipher, who had detected redshifts
                in light from nebulae (later identified as galaxies) in the 1910s. These findings provided
                empirical support for Georges Lemaître's theoretical prediction of an expanding universe,
                derived from Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity (Einstein, 1917). The idea of an
                expanding cosmos marked a departure from the long-held belief in a static universe,
                transforming our understanding of the cosmos.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even more evidence for the universe's expansion came when cosmic
                background radiation (CMB) was found in 1965 by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson. CMB is
                a faint microwave radiation permeating through the universe. It was initially interpreted as
                the residual heat from the Big Bang. This discovery proved the predictions made by the Big
                Bang theory and provided a view of the universe when it was 380,000 years old (Penzias
                and Wilson, 1965).
            </p>
            <p>
                The uniformity and slight anisotropies in the CMB, observed from space probes such as COBE,
                WMAP, and Planck, show scientists what the universe looked like when it was young and
                how it evolved as time passed. The measured characteristics of CMB prove the theory of
                an expanding universe, which began approximately 13.8 billion years ago (Planck
                Collaboration, 2018).
            </p>
            <p>
                Another discovery in the expansion of the universe is the constantly increasing rate of
                expansion. In the late 1990s, two independent research teams studying Type Ia supernovae
                (a class of standardizable cosmic candles) found that distant supernovae were dimmer
                than expected. This showed them that the universe's expansion was speeding up rather
                than slowing down (Riess et al., 1998; Perlmutter et al., 1999).
            </p>
            <p>
                The scientists found that the constantly increasing rate of expansion was because of a force
                called dark energy, which makes up approximately 68% of the universe's total energy density
                (Planck Collaboration, 2018). Even though scientists barely understand the force, dark
                energy is thought to act as a repulsive force counteracting the attractive force of gravity. The
                prevailing model of cosmology, the ΛCDM model, incorporates dark energy as the
                cosmological constant (Λ), which was introduced by Einstein and later repurposed to
                explain the phenomenon.

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
                The ever-expanding universe is a testament to the power of scientific inquiry and human
                curiosity. From Hubble’s groundbreaking observations to the ongoing exploration of dark
                energy, the study of cosmic expansion has revolutionized our understanding of the universe
                and its origins. While significant questions remain, advances in observational technology
                and theoretical physics promise to illuminate the mysteries of the cosmos. As we continue
                to probe the nature of the expanding universe, we deepen our connection to the infinite and
                the unknown.
